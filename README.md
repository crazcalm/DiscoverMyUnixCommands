DiscoverMyUnixCommands
======================

Problem:
--------
      I have all of these useful terminal commands on my computer but do not know
    what they are, or where they are located.

Solution:
---------
      I am writing a tool to list out, and filter, my computer's
    potentional terminal commands.

Back Story:
-----------
      I was reading "Python: for Unix and Linux System Administration" when I
    came accross the default location for most of my computer's terminal
    commands. While looking through the list, I realized that I only know
    of the more common commands, but there a plenty of other useful commands
    on my computer.

      I am writing this tool in hope that I can use it to become more familiar
    with these commands.
